Class: Fluid Mechanics (MAE 3230)

This project involved disassembling and dissecting a HONDA WX15 engine-powered water pump. Our group analyzed both the carburetor and the centrifugal pump; I focused on the pump portion, which included disassembling the pump to inspect the impeller, seals, and internal flow paths, then analyzing how fluid moves through the pump during typical operation. This work contributed to a larger video explaining the pump’s design and fluid mechanics.
