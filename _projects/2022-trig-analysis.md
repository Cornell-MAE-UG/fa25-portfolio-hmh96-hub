Class: Fluid Mechanics (MAE 3230)

This project involved the disassembly and analysis of a HONDA WX15 engine-powered water pump. Our group analyzed both the carburetor and the centrifugal pump; We focused our analysis on the pump portion, which included disassembling the pump to inspect the impeller, seals, and internal flow paths, then analyzing how fluid moves through the pump during typical operation. We took data from product specs available online and equations and understanding gained from out fluid dynamics class and textbook to determine the functional values of this fluid machine. This work contributed to a larger video, shown below, explaining the pump’s design and fluid mechanics.
